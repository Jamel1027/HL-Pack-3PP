<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War (TheIronGolem) Make sure that all stances get the User.Activation tag, as some stances were not receiving it for some reason and thus not being activatable. Fixed a couple of Iron Tortoise stances that weren't applying effects in time. Added bootstraps to Body of the Night and Turtle Knight's Stance, so that they grant Poison Use and Improved Uncanny Dodge, respectively. Removed the now-superfluous StanceUp tags from PoW class configurables, which was allowing one extra stance to be on without validation errors.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) Aligned scripts. Changed the pushing of Discipline Tags to a much later timing.   Added sort tags to adjustments so they sort correctly.</li>
<li>Path of War (TheIronGolem) Added a "max maneuver level" array to PWManList component, which enforces custom maneuver-level-by-IL restrictions.  This is only needed for classes/archetypes that have a nonstandard progression. Added the PathOfWar.CstManProg tag, which designates a maneuver list as using the custom maneuver progression described above. Some minor spelling corrections.</li>
<li>Path of War (TheIronGolem) Removed PathOfWar.Stance tag from Dragon War God's Dance, so that it doesn't show up as available for stance selection.</li>
<li>Path of War (TheIronGolem) Path of War: Removed "trkMax" fieldval assignments from maneuvers, as this was causing maneuvers to display as being usable twice per encounter.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) Removed the "Source" from Class Specials as they are not needed. Added "Community Psionics" Product ID tag instead.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (TheIronGolem) Removed unnecessary scripts from Alter Mind Blade and Alter Mind Bolt.</li>
</ul>       

<strong>v1.4 February 8, 2015</strong>
<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War - (IronGolem) Warlords are now correctly marked as proficient with shields (not just bucklers).</li>
<li>Path of War - (IronGolem) Initiating prestige classes now correctly add their full level to IL of existing initiating classes.</li>
<li>Path of War - (IronGolem) Fixed a bug that allowed initiating PrC's to select their own configurables for IL calculation.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Fixed Mind Shield as it wasn't removing AC bonus when 2H mindblade equipped.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Absorbing Blade - added summary text.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Dazzling Blade - added DC.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Energized Shield - added requirment scripts.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Expand Shield - correct description.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Freezing Ice - corrected prereq scripts.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Improved Mind Shield - changed uniqeness (many other skills had to have this change too).</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Lightning Arc - added DC.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Mark of the Challenger - corrected description.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Thunder Blade - added DC.</li>
<li>Tome of Secrets - (ShadowChemosh) Added (ToS) in front of the Tome of Secrets classes. As the names are similar to other popular classes.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) Basic Pack updated to v3.6.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) Script review of new changes and bug fixes. Merged in manually the UP changes from psych777 into github.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Autohypnosis skill description updated to full text. Changed to be manually added to characters instead of always being on all characters. So if you want this skill on your character you will need to add it again after this update.</li>
<li>Path of War - (IronGolem) Added the Umbral Blade prestige class.</li>
<li>Path of War - (IronGolem) Added the Awakened Blade prestige class.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics - (psych777) Added text entries for: Advanced Talents, Deadly Shield, Evasion, Flurry of Fists, Flurry of Fists, Improved Flurry of Fists, Greater Grasping Shield, Improved Armor, Improved Evasion, Interupting Throw, Mental Power, Ranged Shield Block, Rogue Talent, Shield Block, Trapfinder, & Whiplash.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War - (IronGolem) Added "PathOfWar.ShdwBlade" tag, for denoting when a weapon is affected by the Umbral Blade's Shadow Blade ability.</li>
<li>Path of War - (IronGolem) Added "PathOfWar.EmbShadow" and "PathOfWar.StaInnrEye" tags, which is used by the Embrace the Shadows and Stance of the Inner Eye class specials, and others that interact with them.</li>
<li>Path of War - (IronGolem) Added the PWgetIMod and PWgetIlvl procedures, so class specials can easily fetch the initiator level or modifier for whatever class they come from</li>
<li>Path of War - (ShadowChemosh) Built a new component (PWManList) that can hold the Maneuver/Stance array values for PoW classes. Several of the procedures used on PoW classes and Configurables are now deprecated as the logic was moved to the new background component. PWManList will hold not only array values but Initiator Level and the attribute used to calculate maneuver DC values. This allows for future classes that use both PoW maneuvers and spellcasting to work.</li>
<li>Path of War - (ShadowChemosh) Built new editor tab (zCommunity->PoW Class Setup) that allows a very easy method of linking the PoW Class to its PoW Configurable. It also allows for setting up which Disciplines the class has access to.</li>
